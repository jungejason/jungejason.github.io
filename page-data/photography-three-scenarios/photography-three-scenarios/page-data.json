The reason he told is that he felt that the modern day camera becomes to be like a computer instead of a comera. It’s getting too complicated. He wants to enjoy the pure photographing experience which. The aligned with the story of an old friend of me. The friend told me that he likes the “mechanic” experience of the Leica system. I didn’t understand it well at that time because I was new to photography. But now, after playing with cameras and lenses for one and a half years, I start to understand it. It’s to take control of the basic of photographing: aperture, ISO, shutter speed, and focus. Then composition.</p>\n<p>I personally like manually control as well. But I do need auto system for kids running around. And I sometimes need a quick mode to record life. So I think there are three scenarios for photography for me:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Auto Scenario</strong>: kids running around. Use the auto mode and whatever way the camera can provide me</li>\n<li><strong>Manual Scenario</strong>: take a photo nicely. Use total manual mode</li>\n<li><strong>Quick Scenario</strong>: recording life quickly.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For the Auto Scenario, I practiced it today with intention. I took the Sony Z7Rv with just one lens, Zeiss ZA 35mm f/1.4 when the family went out for lunch in an India restaurant. I wanted to take some good photos for the kids. And it worked out.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/05e4b2d9610b42e25c2803bcbf2a80f8/146e0/auto-scenario-kids-DSC01969.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"auto-scenario-kids-DSC01969.jpeg\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/05e4b2d9610b42e25c2803bcbf2a80f8/1c72d/auto-scenario-kids-DSC01969.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/05e4b2d9610b42e25c2803bcbf2a80f8/a80bd/auto-scenario-kids-DSC01969.jpg 148w,\n/static/05e4b2d9610b42e25c2803bcbf2a80f8/1c91a/auto-scenario-kids-DSC01969.jpg 295w,\n/static/05e4b2d9610b42e25c2803bcbf2a80f8/1c72d/auto-scenario-kids-DSC01969.jpg 590w,\n/static/05e4b2d9610b42e25c2803bcbf2a80f8/a8a14/auto-scenario-kids-DSC01969.jpg 885w,\n/static/05e4b2d9610b42e25c2803bcbf2a80f8/fbd2c/auto-scenario-kids-DSC01969.jpg 1180w,\n/static/05e4b2d9610b42e25c2803bcbf2a80f8/146e0/auto-scenario-kids-DSC01969.jpg 5337w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>For the Manual Scenario, I played with all the three Sony bodies I have, and can set up a manual mode which I control everything with as fewer steps as possible. It’s idea to use dials to control the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. It worked out OK on NEX-6 and ZV-E10, and worked out very well on A7Rv. I didn’t have chance to go out to try the Manual Scenario today.</p>\n<p>For the Quick Scenario, I need a real pocket camera. Ricoh GR iii seems to be the best option. The popular Fujifilm X100 seems to be good, but after careful check, it’s actually not a real pocket camera. If I have to use a strap to carry it, then it overlaps with the existing camera body I have. The NEX-6 is small and with some good lens it’s not that much bigger than the Fujifilm X100 camera for my use case. I can even use A7Rv for serious street photography. Because I don’t do the quick mode that often, I can take my time to find a good deal for Ricoh GR iii.</p>\n<p>If I stick to the three scenario, I’m skipping one scenario which I have often been doing: try to use auto functionalities to take good photos and play with lenses. I should substitute it with the Manual Scenario instead in which I can enjoy the pure joy of photography more. Less is more.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Photography Three Scenarios","date":"February 24, 2024","description":"Three Scenarios for Photography","tags":["photography"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/photography-three-scenarios/photography-three-scenarios/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/photography-how-to-photograph-flowers/photography-how-to-photograph-flowers/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Photograph Flowers","tags":["photography","technique","tipis","flowers"]}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["426816048","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
